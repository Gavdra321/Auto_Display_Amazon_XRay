# Amazon X-Ray Auto Display
I put this together quickly because there is no way to see when new amazon xray trivia shows up.
Unpacked chrome extension, does nothing except check for new trivia and display the list

## Setup
- Download code to local folder
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Click "Load Unpacked"
- Select Local Folder with code
- Enable Extension
- THATS IT
- Next time you watch a movie that has amazon xray enjoy seeing the trivia
